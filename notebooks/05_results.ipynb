    "# 📊 Bellabeat Case Study: Data Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed 11 datasets related to user activity, sleep, heart rate, and weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `daily_activity`\n",
    "- `heartrate`\n",
    "- `hourly_calories`\n",
    "- `hourly_intensities`\n",
    "- `hourly_steps`\n",
    "- `minute_calories`\n",
    "- `minute_intensities`\n",
    "- `minute_mets`\n",
    "- `minute_sleep`\n",
    "- `minute_steps`\n",
    "- `weight_log`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cleaning Highlights**:\n",
    "- ✅ No missing or duplicate values (except `Fat` in `weight_log`)\n",
    "- ✅ Data types were standardized\n",
    "- ✅ Merged relevant datasets to form a cleaned, unified structure\n",

    "## 📈 Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Activity vs. Sedentary Behavior\n",
    "- Users who walked more had **fewer sedentary minutes**.\n",
    "- A **negative correlation** was observed between `TotalSteps` and `SedentaryMinutes`.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Weekday vs. Weekend Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day Type | Avg Steps | Avg Calories | Avg Sedentary Minutes |\n",
    "|----------|------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| Weekday  | 8,334      | 2,429         | 665                     |\n",
    "| Weekend  | 6,645      | 2,308         | 674                     |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weekdays**: higher activity, more calories burned, slightly less sedentary time\n",
    "- **Weekends**: lower overall activity, slightly better sleep engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Time of Day Patterns\n",
    "- **Afternoon** and **Evening** are peak times for activity.\n",
    "- **Night** remains consistently low in intensity for all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Intensity Deciles by Time & Day Type\n",
    "- Users in higher deciles are more active, particularly on **weekday afternoons** and **evenings**.\n",
    "- **Weekend activity** is more balanced but slightly lower overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations (line and bar plots) demonstrated these patterns clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Insights & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🕒 **Evenings and afternoons** are prime activity times. Bellabeat can schedule fitness challenges or reminders accordingly.\n",
    "2. 📆 **Weekday engagement** is higher. Consider campaigns targeted during the week.\n",
    "3. 💤 **Sleep tracking is underutilized** — only 23 users logged sleep. Bellabeat should promote this feature.\n",
    "4. 🪞 **Night hours** are least active — a great opportunity to promote mindfulness and light stretching content.\n",
